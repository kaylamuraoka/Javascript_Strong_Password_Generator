# Javascript_Strong_Password_Generator

## Description

This is an application that an employee can use to randomly generate a strong password in order to provide greater security when accessing sensitive data. This app feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript.

This application works in a few simple steps:

1. Given that an employee needs a new, secure password, they can click the red labeled "Generate Password"
2. Then they will be presented with a series of prompts asking them to confirm the length and character types (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters) they'd like included in their password.
3. After all prompts are answered, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria and is displayed in the textbox in the center of the page.

The following gif shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

## Credits

The original webpage design and layout (index.html and style.css) code was provided, which I then enhanced the script.js file so that when a user clicks the button to generate a password it actually works. I also refrenced this [list of Password Special Characters from the OWASP Foundation](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters).
